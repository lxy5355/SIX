1. binary choice model description: note heteroskedasticity nature of it and a possible advantage of KS over Ichimura; 
2. bandwidth selection: which method is used in the NP package, why to take average of it;
3. interprete why the result of KS is much better;
4. a deeper understanding of NP package;
5. search for methods for comparison: besides MSE and Bias;
(5. dig into theory)

skewed distribution and data size
choose more starting points to check for whether it matters
ks vs. ichimura, moment conditions? what is that.
