Purpose of the different files:

    * :file:`research_paper.tex` contains the actual paper. This builds on three blocks: theoretical outline; simulations, where finite sample properties are analyzed; and a real data set example, where one can illus- trate the use of semi-parametric estimation methods on an applied framework and compare it with the conventional logistic regression.
    * :file:`research_pres_30min.tex` contains a typical conference presentation, which summarizes theoretical part, simulations and empirical part.
