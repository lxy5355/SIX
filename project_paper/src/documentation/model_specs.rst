Model specifications
********************

These are specifications of parameters that characterize data draws and estimation.

* models 1, 2 and 3 differentiate with each other in sample size.

* models 3 and 4 are compared based on differenct specification of error distribution.

* all models share the same simulation trials, true value of estimator, estimation grids and bandwidth for kernel estimation.
