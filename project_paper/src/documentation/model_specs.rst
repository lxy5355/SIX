Model specifications
********************

These are specifications of parameters that characterize data draws and estimation:

* models 1, 2 and 3 differ from each other in sample size;

* models 3 and 4 contain different specifications of the error distribution;

* all models share the same number of simulation trials, true value of the coeficient to be estimated, estimation grids and bandwidth for kernel estimation.
