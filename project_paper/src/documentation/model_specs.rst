Model specifications
********************

These are specifications of parameters that characterize data draws and estimation:

* models 1, 2 and 3 differ from each other in sample size;

* models 3 and 4 are compared based on different specifications of the error distribution;

* all models share the same simulation trials, true value of estimator, estimation grids and bandwidth for kernel estimation.
